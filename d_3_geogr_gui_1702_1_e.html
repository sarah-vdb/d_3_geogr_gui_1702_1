               <h2>The Diploma Programme</h2>
               <p>The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for
                  students in the 16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims
                  to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and
                  compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop
                  intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them
                  to respect and evaluate a range of points of view. </p>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>The Diploma Programme model</h3>
                  <p>The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see
                     figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of academic
                     areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern language and a
                     classical language); a humanities or social science subject; an experimental
                     science; mathematics; and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive
                     range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study
                     designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of
                     the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which
                     means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they
                     may wish to study further at university. </p>

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Choosing the right combination</h3>
                  <p>Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic
                     areas, although they can, instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from
                     another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at
                     higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
                     recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at
                     HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL. </p>
                  <p>At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical
                     thinking and analysis. At the end of the course, students’ abilities are
                     measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of
                     coursework assessed by teachers. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>The core of the Diploma Programme model</h3>
                  <p>All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that
                     make up the core of the model. </p>
                  <p>Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical
                     thinking and inquiry into the process of knowing rather than about learning a
                     specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the nature of knowledge and
                     how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
                     analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of
                     knowledge. The task of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared
                     knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an individual
                     becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ
                     from others. </p>
                  <p>Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme.
                     The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to develop their own identities, in
                     accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission statement and
                     the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
                     their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of
                     CAS are creativity (arts, and other experiences that involve creative
                     thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and
                     service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the
                     student). Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS
                     contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world
                     through intercultural understanding and respect. </p>
                  <p>The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the
                     opportunity for IB students to investigate a topic of special interest, in the
                     form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of research
                     undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects,
                     or in the case of the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and
                     acquaints them with the independent research and writing skills expected at
                     university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured
                     writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and
                     coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended
                     to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and
                     creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an
                     opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the
                     guidance of a supervisor. </p>

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning</h3>
                  <p>Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to
                     deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and
                     learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically linked with the
                     learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
                     preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of
                     approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of
                        content</li>
                     <li>empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning
                        experiences in which students are more meaningfully engaged in structured
                        inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking </li>
                     <li>promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course
                        aspirations) and linking previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of
                        learning) </li>
                     <li>encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip
                        them to continue to be actively engaged in learning after they leave school,
                        and to help them not only obtain university admission through better grades
                        but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond </li>
                     <li>enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma
                        Programme experience</li>
                     <li>allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme
                        education, with its blend of idealism and practicality. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills,
                     communication skills, self-management skills and research skills) along with
                     the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry-based, conceptually
                     focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by
                     assessment) encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.

                  <h3>The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile</h3>
                  <p>The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and
                     attitudes they will need to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the
                     organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning
                     in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the
                     organization’s educational philosophy. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Academic honesty</h3>
                  <p>Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours
                     informed by the attributes of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and
                     assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal integrity, engender
                     respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all
                     students have an equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they
                     acquire during their studies. </p>
                  <p>All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic,
                     based on the student’s individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of
                     others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that require teachers to provide
                     guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be

                  <h3>Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person</h3>
                  <p>Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all
                     sources used in work submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a
                     clarification of this requirement. </p>
                  <p>Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media
                     that may include audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
                     published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas
                     of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard
                     style of referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to
                     acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of
                     regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award
                     committee. </p>
                  <p>The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation
                     should be used by candidates; this is left to the discretion of appropriate
                     faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects, different
                     response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical
                     and restrictive to insist on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may
                     prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a style that is
                     appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’
                     work is written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a
                     given subject, it is expected that the minimum information given includes: name
                     of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as
                     applicable. </p>
                  <p>Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that
                     credit is given to all sources used, including sources that have been
                     paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must clearly
                     distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation
                     marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate
                     citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an electronic source is
                     cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to
                     show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that
                     all sources have been acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that
                     audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or
                     in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source.
                     Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used. </p>

                  <h3>Geography</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                     <p>“Geography is the only subject that has given me the skills to interpret and
                        understand reality in a way I could not imagine before and that will remain
                        for life.” </p>
                     <span class="attribution">A student at the British School of Rio de Janeiro
                        (2013)</span>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Geography is a dynamic subject that is firmly grounded in the real world and
                     focuses on the interactions between individuals, societies and physical
                     processes in both time and space. It seeks to identify trends and patterns in
                     these interactions. It also investigates the way in which people adapt and
                     respond to change, and evaluates actual and possible management strategies
                     associated with such change. Geography describes and helps to explain the
                     similarities and differences between different places. These may be defined on
                     a variety of scales and from the perspectives of a different range of actors,
                     with varying powers over decision-making processes. </p>
                  <p>Within individuals and societies subjects, geography is distinctive in its
                     spatial dimension and occupies a middle ground between social or human sciences
                     and natural sciences. The Diploma Programme geography course integrates
                     physical, environmental and human geography, and ensures that students acquire
                     elements of both socio‑economic and scientific methodologies. Geography takes
                     advantage of its position to examine relevant concepts and ideas from a wide
                     variety of disciplines. This helps students develop life skills and have an
                     appreciation of, and a respect for, alternative approaches, viewpoints and
                     ideas. </p>

                  <h3>Distinction between SL and HL</h3>
                  <p>Students at SL and HL in geography are presented with a syllabus that has
                     optional geographic themes and a common SL and HL core. HL students also study
                     the HL core extension. The syllabus requires the development of certain skills,
                     attributes and knowledge as described in the assessment objectives, which are
                     externally assessed. Although the skills and activity of studying geography are
                     common to both SL and HL students, HL students are required to acquire a
                     further body of knowledge, to demonstrate critical evaluation and to further
                     synthesize the concepts in the HL extension. </p>
                  <p>In summary:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>SL students study two optional themes; HL students study three optional
                        themes, providing further breadth. </li>
                     <li>Both SL and HL students study the core geographic perspectives—global
                        change. </li>
                     <li>HL students study the HL extension geographic perspectives—global
                        interactions, and further examine, evaluate and synthesize the prescribed
                        concepts, which by their nature are complex, contestable, interlinked and
                        require holistic treatment. This provides further depth at HL. </li>
                     <li>Both SL and HL students complete a fieldwork study for the internal
                        assessment.</li>

                     <h4>Geography and theory of knowledge</h4>
                     <p>The relationship between each subject and theory of knowledge (TOK) is
                        important and fundamental to the Diploma Programme. Having followed a course
                        of study in individuals and societies, students should be able to reflect
                        critically on the various processes of knowing and methods used in human
                        sciences, helping them to become “inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young
                        people” (IB mission statement). </p>
                     <p>Many of the subjects that fall within the individuals and societies subject
                        group in the Diploma Programme are often known collectively as the “human
                        sciences” or “social sciences”. The human sciences are one of the eight
                        areas of knowledge at the centre of the TOK course, with the others being
                        mathematics, the natural sciences, the human sciences, the arts, history,
                        ethics, religious knowledge systems, and indigenous knowledge systems. In
                        TOK, students also explore the question of how we know what we claim to know
                        by examining different ways of knowing, which are specified in the TOK
                        course as language, sense perception, emotion, reason, imagination, faith,
                        intuition, and memory. </p>
                     <p>As with other disciplines in the human sciences, there are a variety of ways
                        of gaining knowledge in geography —for example, archival evidence, data
                        collection, experimentation, observation, and inductive and deductive
                        reasoning. Geography students also explore and think critically about the
                        interactions between people and their environment in time and place. All of
                        these elements can be used to help explain patterns of behaviour and
                        contribute to an examination of how we know what we claim to know. </p>
                     <p>During the Diploma Programme geography course, a number of opportunities
                        will arise that can be used to highlight the relationship and common goals
                        between TOK and geography. Some of the knowledge questions and claims that
                        might be considered during the geography course are identified below. </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Who decides how we classify knowledge? Why might it be useful to
                           classify knowledge?</li>
                        <li>To what extent are the methods of the human sciences scientific?</li>
                        <li>How is statistical data used differently in different areas of
                           knowledge?</li>
                        <li>How reliable are the methods available for gathering demographic data on
                           hundreds of millions of people? </li>
                        <li>How has ready access to vast amounts of information, and the way in
                           which the internet has contributed to our shrinking world, changed our
                           understanding of knowledge? </li>
                        <li>Does language simply describe knowledge, or is it part of the knowledge
                           itself?</li>
                        <li>To what extent do maps reflect reality? What are the hidden messages in
                           maps and the stories behind the way maps are presented? </li>
                        <li>Some geographical topics, such as climate change, are controversial. How
                           does the scientific method attempt to address them? Are such topics
                           always within the scope of the scientific method? </li>
                        <li>What scientific or social factors might influence the study of a complex
                           phenomenon such as global warming? </li>
                        <li>On what basis might we decide between the judgments of experts if they
                           disagree with each other? </li>
                        <li>Arguably, while some aspects of geography can be measured, others
                           cannot. To what extent does knowledge need to be quantifiable? </li>
                        <li>Many geographers and others value diversity in human affairs. Does
                           globalization increase opportunities to share knowledge or does it
                           diminish diversity? </li>
                        <li>What roles do emotion and reason play in individuals’ lifestyle
                           choices?</li>
                        <li>To what extent might possession of knowledge carry with it moral
                           obligations?</li>

                     <h4>Geography and creativity, activity, service</h4>
                     <p>Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each
                        of the subject groups of the Diploma Programme. CAS and geography can
                        complement each other in a number of ways; identifying trends and patterns
                        between individuals, societies and processes and how these may manifest in
                        local, regional or global issues may give students ideas for CAS
                        experiences. </p>
                     <p>An important characteristic of the geography course is that students examine
                        spatial interactions, possibilities and change in a contextual way. Due to
                        the interconnectedness of our contemporary world, many global challenges may
                        present themselves in students’ local or otherwise significant communities
                        as inspiring springboards for CAS experiences. As a result of the knowledge
                        and understanding students develop about issues through a geographic lens,
                        they might be able to investigate, plan, act, reflect on and demonstrate CAS
                        experiences in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS
                        experiences can ignite students’ passions for addressing a particular global
                        matter. </p>
                     <p>The challenge and enjoyment of CAS experiences can often have a profound
                        effect on geography students, who might choose, for example, to engage with
                        CAS in the following ways. </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Plan, participate and implement an activity to help educate selected
                           members of a community about the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable
                           Development Goals regarding habitation and inequality, with virtual
                           reality screenings that increase awareness of the reality of refugee
                           migration. </li>
                        <li>Take lessons in surfing, or another physical pursuit, while completing
                           internal assessment fieldwork. This could be accomplished as a single
                           experience or through a series of sessions, or by encouraging others to
                           participate in—or perhaps extend—the experience by creating a community
                           environmental group. </li>
                        <li>Explore perspectives on regional access to employment, demonstrating an
                           ongoing interest through the mediums of storytelling and craftivism that
                           advocate awareness of a particular gender’s position. </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>A CAS experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of
                        events. However, CAS experiences must be distinct from and may not be
                        included or used in the student’s Diploma course requirements. </p>

                     <h4>Geography and the extended essay or world studies extended essay</h4>
                     <p>An extended essay in geography is not an extension of the internal
                        assessment task for the subject. Students must ensure that they understand
                        the clear distinction between the internal assessment and the extended
                        essay. While there is inevitably an overlap in the skills being developed,
                        there are clear distinctions between the tasks and a different emphasis in
                        terms of the sources and types of data used. </p>
                     <p>An extended essay in geography provides the student with an opportunity to
                        apply a range of geographic skills to complete an independent and in-depth
                        research investigation using geographic concepts, methodologies, theories,
                        and sources with a clear spatial emphasis. </p>
                     <p>It is important that the topic of the essay is geographic and gives a clear
                        indication of the nature of the research. The essay topic may relate to an
                        area of the Diploma Programme geography course, but this is not a
                        requirement and other areas of the wider subject may be explored. </p>
                     <p>The scope of the essay should not be too broad, as such essays are rarely
                        successful. The research question should be single and focused, clearly
                        stated and must be framed in question form. It is the task of the supervisor
                        to ensure that the research question is relevant to the subject, leads the
                        student along a path that utilizes appropriate geographic sources, and
                        encourages the application of relevant subject concepts, theories or ideas. </p>
                     <p>It is important that the geographic and theoretical context is well
                        established early in the essay. Investigations carried out at a local scale
                        usually meet the expectations of the higher bands of the markscheme. This
                        narrow focus discourages an over-reliance on published materials and
                        encourages original research. It is rare for an essay that is based entirely
                        on published texts to score highly. Investigations conducted in a location
                        that is familiar and accessible to the student have a much greater chance of
                        achieving success through more personal involvement, which in turn
                        encourages greater in-depth research. </p>
                     <p>The geographic context in which the research is being conducted should be
                        clearly outlined, usually with the aid of one or more annotated maps and,
                        where relevant, photographs and/or satellite images. </p>
                     <p>The extended essay should focus on individual research and avoid approaches
                        involving group fieldwork data collection. Although there may be some
                        similarities in approach to the geography internal assessment, the extended
                        essay should not place so strong an emphasis on primary field data
                        collection and processing. Many successful research topics are based on
                        published data such as census or weather records. The emphasis should
                        therefore be more on written analysis, interpretation, discussion, critical
                        evaluation and the development of a coherent, reasoned argument than on the
                        techniques of data collection and processing. </p>
                     <p>A descriptive or narrative approach should be avoided. Information on the
                        methodology of the investigation is essential, as is the collection of
                        high-quality data and information. It is vital that the investigation is
                        tailored closely to the research question and shows evidence of careful
                        planning. </p>
                     <p>Appropriate resources for an extended essay in geography could include both
                        primary and secondary data and/or quantitative and qualitative information,
                        obtained from books, newspapers and magazines; interviews; questionnaires;
                        the internet; maps; aerial photographs and satellite images; digital
                        landscape simulations; videos; geographic information systems (GIS);
                        diagrams and models. Geographical data should be analysed using appropriate
                        quantitative, statistical, graphical or qualitative techniques, and the
                        findings should be critically evaluated. </p>
                     <p>Indication of the possible range of topics, research questions and
                        approaches that can be considered can be found in the <em>Extended essay

                  <h3>Geography and international-mindedness</h3>
                  <p>The geography course conceptually and contextually embodies international and
                     global awareness in several distinctive approaches. It examines key world
                     issues, such as the nexus of sustainable environmental, societal and economic
                     development, and climate change. It considers examples and case studies at a
                     variety of scales, from local to regional, national, international and global.
                     Throughout the course, teachers have considerable flexibility in their choice
                     of examples and case studies as content in order to ensure that Diploma
                     Programme geography is a highly appropriate way to meet the needs of all
                     students, regardless of their geographical location. Inherent to the syllabus
                     is a consideration of different perspectives, economic circumstances and social
                     and cultural diversity. </p>
                  <p>Geography seeks to develop international understanding and foster a concern for
                     global issues as well as to raise students’ awareness of their own
                     responsibility at a local level. Geography also aims to develop values and
                     attitudes that will help students reach a degree of personal commitment in
                     trying to resolve these issues, appreciating our shared responsibility as
                     citizens of an increasingly interconnected and ever shrinking world. </p>

                  <h3>Engaging with sensitive topics</h3>
                  <p>The optional themes, the core SL and HL themes, and the HL extension cover
                     areas of knowledge that are often affected by personal bias and value
                     judgments. It is important that teachers are aware of this and ensure that
                     students are not only presented with the facts but are taught the analytical
                     skills to allow accurate interpretation and evaluation of these contemporary
                     themes. </p>

                     background in terms of specific subjects studied for national or international
                     qualifications is expected or required. The skills needed for the geography
                     course are developed within the context of the course itself. </p>

                  <h3>Links to the Middle Years Programme</h3>
                  <p>Geography is often offered explicitly as one of the disciplines within the
                     individuals and societies subject group of the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP).
                     Regardless of whether the learner takes geography or another discipline within
                     MYP individuals and societies, the course provides a strong foundation for
                     students who go on to study Diploma Programme geography. </p>
                  <p>Like the Diploma Programme geography course, MYP individuals and societies is a
                     concept-driven curriculum aimed at helping the learner to develop broader and
                     deeper levels of understanding and critical and creative thinking. MYP
                     individuals and societies courses are framed by four prescribed <strong>key
                        concepts</strong>: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>change</li>
                     <li>global interactions</li>
                     <li>time, place and space</li>
                     <li>systems.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These broad, enduring and powerful ideas are used as lenses to give breadth to
                     learning in each unit of study, and to enable students to transfer knowledge
                     across disciplines. The <strong>related concepts</strong> in any MYP
                     individuals and societies course add depth to learning in terms of facilitating
                     more subject-specific understanding. Diploma Programme geography adopts a
                     similar concept-based approach, using the four <strong>key concepts</strong> of
                     place, process, power and possibility to underpin the entire course, alongside
                     other organizing and topic-specific specialist concepts that provide depth to
                     the understanding of the different geographic inquiries (see figure 3). </p>
                  <p>Inquiry-based learning is central to individuals and societies courses in both
                     the MYP and the Diploma Programme, providing students with opportunities to
                     independently and collaboratively investigate and analyse relevant issues. As
                     inquiry develops curiosity and promotes active critical and creative thinking,
                     it is important to emphasize that pedagogically, a Diploma Programme geography
                     learning environment should be very similar in nature to the MYP experience. </p>
                  <p>MYP individuals and societies students are required to practise and develop
                     their investigation skills, one of the MYP four assessment objectives, giving
                     an important foundation for the internal assessment component of the Diploma
                     Programme geography course. The MYP assessment objective of thinking critically
                     also corresponds to the higher order assessment objectives of evaluation and
                     synthesis that are expected from a Diploma Programme geography student. </p>
                  <p>Across the MYP, there are 16 key concepts with the four highlighted below as
                     the focus for MYP individuals and societies. </p>

                  <h3>Links to the Career-related Programme</h3>
                  <p>In the IB Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two Diploma
                     Programme subjects, a core consisting of four components and a career-related
                     study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student needs.
                     The CP has been designed to add value to the student’s career-related studies.
                     This provides the context for the choice of Diploma Programme courses. Courses
                     can be chosen from any group of the Diploma Programme. It is also possible to
                     study more than one course from the same group (for example, visual arts and
                     film). </p>
                  <p>Geography may be a beneficial choice for CP students considering careers in,
                     for example, the environmental and resource sphere, health care, tourism
                     industries, the technology industry, social informatics, urban planning or
                     international engagement. Geography helps students to understand the
                     interconnectedness of environments, economies and societies in the contemporary
                     world, and to engage with similarity and diversity in human development.
                     Students explore different places at different scales, from local to global,
                     leading to a greater understanding of the physical and human world around them. </p>
                  <p>Geography encourages the development of strong written, verbal, and visual or
                     graphical communication skills; critical and complex thinking; and ethical
                     considerations that will assist students in preparing for the future global
                     workplace. This in turn fosters the IB learner profile attributes that are
                     transferable to the entire CP, providing relevance and support for the
                     student’s learning. </p>
                  <p>For the CP students, Diploma Programme courses can be studied at SL or HL.
                     Schools can explore opportunities to integrate CP students with Diploma
                     Programme students. </p>

               <h2>Assessment objectives in practice</h2>
               <p>Command terms are classified according to the assessment objectives of:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>AO1 Knowledge and understanding of specified content</li>
                  <li>AO2 Application and analysis of knowledge and understanding</li>

               </ul>
               <p>Although command terms are not used explicitly in the syllabus, students must be
                  familiar with them to understand the depth of treatment required in examination
                  questions. The allocation of marks in examination question markbands also reflects
                  this classification of the assessment objectives. </p>
               <p>There is a progression in demand from AO1 to AO3, while AO4 terms are specific to
                  particular skills and examination questions. Definitions of these command terms
                  are listed in the appendix. The command terms within each classification are

                  <h3>Geography concepts</h3>
                  <p>The “Geography concepts” model (figure 3) shows the six main concepts of the
                     course, with the four key concepts of place, process, power, and possibility at
                     the centre and the organizing concepts of scale and spatial interactions
                     connecting them. <strong>Scale </strong>has both temporal and spatial
                     perspectives. </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Places</strong> can be identified at a variety of
                        <strong>scales</strong>, from local territories or locations to the national
                     or state level. <strong>Places</strong> can be compared according to their
                     cultural or physical diversity, or disparities in wealth or resource endowment.
                     The characteristics of a place may be real or perceived, and <strong>spatial
                        interactions </strong>between places can be considered. </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Processes</strong> are human or physical mechanisms of change, such as
                     migration or weathering. They operate on varying timescales. Linear systems,
                     circular systems, and complex systems are all outcomes of the way in which
                     processes operate and interact. </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Power</strong> is the ability to influence and affect change or
                     equilibrium at different scales. Power is vested in citizens, governments,
                     institutions and other players, and in physical processes in the natural world.
                     Equity and security, both environmental and economic, can be gained or lost as
                     a result of the interaction of powerful forces. </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Possibilities</strong> are the alternative events, futures and outcomes
                     that geographers can model, project or predict with varying degrees of
                     certainty. Key contemporary questions include the degree to which human and
                     environmental systems are sustainable and resilient, and can adapt or change. </p>

               <h2>Geographic skills</h2>
               <p>Geographic skills are essential to the study of geography and reflect the
                  subject’s distinctive methodology and approach. Teaching and learning these skills
                  enriches the students’ understanding of geography and enables them to apply and
                  use appropriate techniques and terminology. It is essential that the skills should
                  be covered throughout the <strong>whole</strong> syllabus and that they are
                  introduced and integrated where appropriate, depending on the context, in the
                  different themes and the SL/HL core and HL extension. It is essential that the
                  skills should be all taught at some stage of the course and are not treated in
                  isolation. </p>
               <p>Students are expected to demonstrate competence in the use of geographic skills in
                  examination papers and internal assessment as appropriate. Those skills indicated
                  below in italics are <strong>not</strong> assessed in the externally assessed
                  examination papers. </p>
               <p>It is recognized that the ability to use GIS as a tool is a valuable geographic
                  skill that goes beyond many of those listed below. Where GIS is accessible and
                  practical, its use is encouraged. </p>

                  <h3>Use of case studies and examples</h3>
                  <p>The recommended teaching approach throughout the course is to focus on the
                     concepts and to use case studies and examples, or detailed examples, to
                     illustrate content and to contextualize these concepts (see figure 2). </p>
                  <p>A case study is located, detailed and used for discussion or a discursive
                     approach. Ideally, case studies selected should be recent; that is, they should
                     have occurred within the student’s lifetime and should not be historical. For
                     example, using the destruction of Pompeii as an example of volcanic destruction
                     is not recommended. If the case studies used are very old, it is likely that
                     they will not offer as much scope for answers as more recent ones. This is
                     because current research and reporting generally produce far more data than
                     previous records. </p>
                  <p>If case studies are required in a response, this will be stated in the question
                     and students are advised, above all, to match the case study to the demands of
                     the question. However, wherever possible, students are encouraged to develop
                     their extended responses using case studies or detailed examples. </p>
                  <p>When examples are used, students should not just provide one-word responses but
                     should offer some development. An example is a sentence or two that enriches an
                     answer; it may include a specific location, an amount, or a date, all showing a
                     greater depth of knowledge and understanding. An examination answer may include
                     reference to many different examples to illustrate or support the response. </p>
                  <p>Advice on the number of case studies or detailed examples to be studied is
                     given, where appropriate, in the sections of the guide devoted to the optional
                     themes, the SL/HL core theme, and the HL extension. </p>

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Geographic models and theories</h3>
                  <p>Students can study models to illustrate concepts relevant to particular topics,
                     but examination questions will not require students to have prior knowledge of
                     any specific model or theory. </p>

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Primary and secondary information</h3>
                  <p>Primary information is material and data collected in the field through
                     measurement and observation. It can include both qualitative and quantitative
                     information. Secondary information is information that has already been
                     compiled in written, statistical or mapped forms. It can include, for example,
                     material from sources such as United Nations (UN) agencies, non‑governmental
                     organizations (NGOs), government publications, statistical yearbooks, telephone
                     directories, censuses or the internet. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Topics for extended essays in geography</h3>
                  <p>Almost all areas of the syllabus lend themselves to deeper analysis and
                     investigation in an extended essay. Many topics offer a wide range of
                     opportunities for extended essays, although care may be needed to ensure that
                     the research question is not too broad to be satisfactorily answered within the
                     word limit. Also, it is important to note that there is a requirement to focus
                     on a narrow area of research in depth, and that an extended essay must have a
                     spatial component. </p>
                  <p>The global nature of the topics in the core themes means that they are not
                     always suitable for extended essays. However, it should be possible to
                     investigate the underlying concepts in extended essays, provided the area of
                     research is at a local scale. As data collection in the field
                     is not required for extended essays, the research questions can be more broadly
                     based than those used for fieldwork and can rely on information derived from
                     sources other than direct fieldwork. </p>

                     at regular intervals. The OCC is a website on which all teachers can post
                     inquiries, present examples of good practice, ask for advice and access
                     exemplar materials. The content of the geography forum on the OCC is provided
                     by geography teachers for geography teachers. The website also includes updates
                     on resources and frequently asked questions, as well as the subject report
                     following each examination or assessment session. </p>

               <h2>Approaches to the teaching and learning of geography</h2>
               <p>The recommended teaching time is 150 hours at SL, and 240 hours at HL. The
                  syllabus is designed to allow sufficient time for in‑depth analysis, evaluation
                  and consolidation of learning. </p>
               <p>Teachers are encouraged to find ways of delivering the course that are most
                  relevant to their students’ interests and to the school’s resources. The overall
                  aim of the course is to give students a deeper understanding of the nature and
                  scope of geography. The different parts of the course should complement each other
                  and the geographic skills must be integrated throughout the course. </p>
               <p>While specific physical or human oriented options are not mandatory, it is
                  strongly advised that teachers in different international settings consider any
                  national education system requirements, and progress to higher education, in the
                  choices made. </p>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Structure of the syllabus</h3>
                  <p>Each option or unit topic is structured to emphasise the conceptual focus of
                     the geographic inquiry, with details relating to the prescribed geographic
                     knowledge and understanding. </p>
                  <p>The order of the content is not an indication of how the optional themes, the
                     SL/HL core theme, and the HL extension are to be delivered. Since many topics
                     and sub‑topics are interrelated, teachers are encouraged to adopt a holistic
                     approach to teaching. For example, a single case study may serve to cover
                     several topics or sub‑topics. </p>
                  <p>Only topics and details in the syllabus will be selected for assessment in the
                     examination papers, although references from the introductory sections of the
                     optional themes, the SL/HL core theme, and the HL extension may occasionally be
                     used to set the context for examination questions. Definitions and a
                     classification of the command terms are published in this guide. </p>
                  <p>The <strong>“</strong>Geographic skills” section lists the skills required in
                     the course that enable students to apply the techniques of geography and use
                     appropriate terminology. It is essential that the skills be covered throughout
                     the whole syllabus (at both SL and HL), that they are delivered through the
                     content and context of the optional themes (the SL/HL core theme and HL
                     extension, as appropriate), and that they are fully integrated into teaching as
                     opposed to being treated individually. Students are expected to demonstrate
                     competence in the use of these skills in both external assessment examination
                     papers and internal assessment, as and when appropriate. </p>

                  <h3>Option A: Freshwater</h3>
                  <p>This optional theme encompasses the physical geography of freshwater in a
                     systems framework, including core elements of hydrology (and the factors and
                     processes that give rise to bankfull discharge and flooding) and fluvial
                     geomorphology (including river process and landform study). </p>
                  <p>It also covers the study of water on the land as a scarce resource requiring
                     careful management, including freshwater bodies such as lakes and aquifers.
                     This includes the ways in which humans respond to the challenges of managing
                     the quantity and quality of freshwater, as well as the consequences (whether
                     intended or unintended, positive or negative) of management within drainage
                     basins. </p>
                  <p>The importance of integrated planning is emphasized, in addition to the
                     geopolitical consequences of growing pressures on internationally shared water
                     resources. </p>
                  <p>Through study of this optional theme, students will develop their understanding
                     of processes, places, power and geographical possibilities. They will
                     additionally gain understanding of other concepts including
                        <strong>systems</strong> (the hydrological cycle), <strong>flood
                        mitigation</strong> (attempts to tackle flooding) and <strong>water
                        security</strong>. </p>

                     escalating geographic challenges might be dealt with. </p>
                  <p>The dual emphasis of the two sections on coastal margins is their physical
                     geography and management. The former deals with processes and landforms. The
                     latter is concerned with the way coastal land and margins are valued and used,
                     and by whom. Where appropriate, the coastal margins of inland seas may be
                     studied in addition to or instead of ocean margins. </p>
                  <p>Through study of this optional theme, students will develop their understanding
                     of processes, places, power and geographical possibilities. They will
                     additionally gain understanding of more specialized concepts including
                        <strong>systems</strong> (oceanic conveyor belts and coastal landform
                     systems), <strong>territories</strong> (exclusive economic zones) and the

                     global contexts make use of their leisure time. As more people join the “global
                     middle class”, they have disposable incomes allowing participation in tourism,
                     including international travel and different types of sport. Sport can also be
                     an important use of leisure time for people on low incomes who cannot afford to
                     participate in tourism. </p>
                  <p>While tourism often has an urban focus, rural areas provide another important
                     geographical setting for touristic activities, including walking, enjoying
                     wilderness, doing extreme sports or visiting heritage sites. The uses made of
                     places vary greatly, depending on physical geography, history and level of
                     economic development. </p>

                  <h3>Option F: Food and health</h3>
                  <p>This optional theme looks at the geography of food and health. Economic
                     development is often accompanied by dietary change and an epidemiological
                     transition in which diseases of poverty become less common and diseases of
                     affluence more common; however, this transition does not apply equally to all
                     sectors of society. </p>
                  <p>Neither food nor health is easy to “measure”, so alternative indicators of food
                     and health are considered. There are many interactions between, and shared
                     influences on, food and health. The role of gender, TNCs and national
                     governments in both food and health provision is considered. This topic
                     considers alternative ways of assessing agricultural sustainability alongside
                     possibilities for improving food supplies and global health over the long term. </p>
                  <p>Through study of this optional theme, students will develop their understanding
                     of processes, places, power and geographical possibilities. They will
                     additionally gain understanding of more specialized concepts including some,
                     such as <strong>diffusion</strong> and <strong>barriers</strong>, which are
                     applicable to both food production systems and the spread of diseases.
                        <strong>Sustainability</strong> is considered in relation to long-term food
                     production. </p>

                  <p>More than 50% of the world’s population now lives in urban environments, with
                     many living in megacities. This optional theme considers the hierarchy of
                     cities and other urban places as sites of intense social interaction and as
                     focal points of production, wealth generation and consumption. They exhibit
                     diversity in patterns of wealth and deprivation, which can result in conflict.
                     They may share common characteristics and processes irrespective of the
                     national level of economic development. </p>
                  <p>Transport improvements have led to rapid growth and shifts in population and
                     economic activities, producing stresses and challenges for urban planners. The
                     theme also considers issues of sustainability, wherein cities need to be
                     managed to minimize harmful social and environmental impacts. </p>
                  <p>Through study of this optional theme, students will develop their understanding

                  <h3>Geographic perspectives—global change</h3>
                  <p>The core theme provides an overview of the geographic foundation for the key
                     global issues of our time. The purpose is to provide a broad factual and
                     conceptual introduction to the geography of population dynamics, climate change
                     and resource consumption issues. </p>
                  <p>The content is underpinned by the four key concepts of the course: places,
                     power, processes and possibilities. Each unit examines issues at different
                     scales from local to global, as well as the interaction between different
                     places. </p>
                  <p>Attention should be given to the positive aspects of change (not only the
                     negative ones), to the need to accept responsibility for seeking solutions to
                     the demographic, economic and environmental issues—and, where appropriate, to
                     the management strategies adopted to meet the challenges. </p>
                  <p>It is not intended for the units to be taught sequentially. The approach to
                     teaching is not prescribed, and the content can be taught with flexibility
                     according to the interests of the learners. </p>
                  <p>Each section of a unit is allocated 7–8 hours of teaching time, which includes
                     time to develop AO3 (synthesis/evaluation) and AO4 (mapping/graphical) skills.

                  <h3>Geographic perspectives—global interactions</h3>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Rationale and conceptual framework</h4>
                     <p>This study of global interactions has a broader perspective than a more
                        conventional study of globalization that emphasizes a linear process
                        involving the domination and the imposition of Western culture on the world.
                        In the context of this syllabus, global interaction suggests a two-way and
                        complex process whereby cultural traits and commodities may be adopted,
                        adapted or resisted by societies. The process is neither inevitable nor
                        universal. </p>
                     <p>The HL extension theme focuses on the global interactions, flows and
                        exchanges arising from the disparities that exist between places. It
                        presents important and contestable geographic issues of change in space and
                        time for the HL student to question. This part of the syllabus is divided
                        into three units relating to global interactions and global development.
                     </p>

                     <h4>Teaching and learning guidance</h4>
                     <p>This sequence of units in the HL core extension is not fixed and may be
                        modified, although it is recommended that unit 4.1 be taught as an
                        introduction. </p>
                     <p>The time allocation provides a rough guide to the depth of study and
                        emphasis required for each. It should also be recognized that there is
                        overlap between concepts, content and contexts, and that these links should
                        be emphasized to give a holistic view of the course. This course allows for
                        student-centred activities including research, presentations and group work.
                        All units must be covered and be illustrated through the use of case studies
                        and local examples where relevant. </p>

               <h2>Assessment in the Diploma Programme</h2>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>General</h3>
                  <p>Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important
                     aims of assessment in the Diploma Programme are that it should support
                     curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and
                     internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark work
                     produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment
                     is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB. </p>
                  <p>There are two types of assessment identified by the IB:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned
                        with providing accurate and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the
                        kind of learning taking place and the nature of students’ strengths and
                        weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and
                        capabilities. Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching
                        quality, as it can provide information to monitor progress towards meeting
                        the course aims and objectives. </li>
                     <li>Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is
                        concerned with measuring student achievement. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to
                     record student achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study.
                     However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used formatively during
                     the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do this. A
                     comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching,
                     learning and course organization. For further information, see the IB
                        <em>Programme standards and practices</em> document. </p>
                  <p>The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not
                     norm-referenced. This approach to assessment judges students’ work by their
                     performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and not in relation
                     to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the
                     Diploma Programme please refer to the publication <em>Diploma Programme
                        assessment: Principles and practice</em>. </p>
                  <p>To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma
                     Programme courses, a variety of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased
                     from the IB store (<a href="http://store.ibo.org">store.ibo.org</a>). Additional publications such as specimen
                     papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and grade
                     descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as
                     markschemes can be purchased from the IB store. </p>

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Methods of assessment</h3>
                  <p>The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.</p>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Assessment criteria</h4>
                     <p>Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each
                        criterion concentrates on a particular skill that students are expected to
                        demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what students should be able
                        to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do
                        it. Using assessment criteria allows discrimination between different
                        answers and encourages a variety of responses. Each criterion comprises a
                        set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is
                        worth one or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a
                        best-fit model. The maximum marks for each criterion may differ according to
                        the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
                        together to give the total mark for the piece of work. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Markbands</h4>
                     <p>Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against
                        which responses are judged. They represent a single holistic criterion
                        divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to a range
                        of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used
                        to ascertain which particular mark to use from the possible range for each
                        level descriptor. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Analytic markschemes</h4>
                     <p>Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that
                        expect a particular kind of response and/or a given final answer from
                        students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to break down
                        the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Marking notes</h4>
                     <p>For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking
                        notes are provided. Marking notes give guidance on how to apply assessment
                        criteria to the particular requirements of a question. </p>

                  <h3>Inclusive assessment arrangements</h3>
                  <p>Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment
                     access requirements. These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to
                     access the examinations and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of
                     the constructs being assessed. </p>
                  <p>The IB document <em>Candidates with assessment access requirements</em>
                     provides details on all the inclusive assessment arrangements available to
                     candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document <em>Learning
                        diversity and inclusion in IB programmes</em> (January 2016) outlines the
                     position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in the
                     IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB
                     documents <em>General regulations: Diploma Programme</em> and the <em>Handbook
                        of procedures for the Diploma Programme</em> provide details on access

               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Purpose of internal assessment</h3>
                  <p>Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is a compulsory
                     component for both SL and HL students. It enables students to demonstrate the
                     application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
                     interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are
                     associated with examination papers. The internal assessment should, as far as
                     possible, be woven into normal practice and classroom teaching, and not be a
                     separate activity conducted after a course has been taught. </p>
                  <p>The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same. The time
                     allowed is 20 hours, and the weightings are 25% at SL and 20% at HL. Students
                     are required to undertake fieldwork collecting primary information and produce
                     one written report that is based on a fieldwork question. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h3>Guidance and authenticity</h3>
                  <p>The SL and HL written reports submitted for internal assessment must be the
                     student’s individual work. However, it is not the intention that students
                     should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internally
                     assessed component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher
                     should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period
                     when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
                     responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed, including
                        the methods of information collection, regulations on group work and the
                        format of the written report </li>
                     <li>the ethical guidelines and risk assessment advice given under the internal
                        assessment requirements in this syllabus </li>
                     <li>the assessment criteria—students must understand that the work submitted
                        for assessment must address these criteria effectively. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students
                     should be encouraged to initiate discussions with the teacher to obtain advice
                     and information, and students must not be penalized for seeking guidance. As
                     part of the learning process, teachers can give advice to students on a first
                     draft of the internally assessed work. This advice should be in terms of the
                     way the work could be improved, but this first draft must not be heavily
                     annotated or edited by the teacher. The next version handed to the teacher
                     after the first draft must be the final one. However, if a student could not
                     have completed the work without substantial support from the teacher, this
                     should be recorded. </p>
                  <p>It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the
                     basic meaning and significance of concepts that relate to academic honesty,
                     especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must ensure that
                     all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and
                     must explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be
                     entirely their own. Where collaboration between students is permitted, it must
                     be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and
                     collusion. </p>
                  <p>All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated
                     by a teacher, and must not include any known instances of suspected academic
                     misconduct. Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the
                     content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following. </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The student’s initial proposal</li>
                     <li>The first draft of the written work</li>
                     <li>The references cited</li>
                     <li>The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the
                        student</li>
                     <li> The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such
                        as www.turnitin.com.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Group work</h3>
                  <p>Group work may be undertaken by students as described below but the written
                     report must be the students’ individual work. </p>
                  <p>The fieldwork topic, fieldwork question and methods of information collection
                     may be chosen by the teacher, the whole class, small groups or individuals. In
                     the early stages of the investigation, students may collect fieldwork
                     information in groups and collaborate on these findings and suitable methods of
                     presentation. </p>
                  <p>Once the research is completed and the necessary fieldwork information and
                     possible methods of presentation exchanged, the emphasis must be on individual
                     work. The writing of the report, the justification of methods, the analysis and
                     the conclusion must be entirely the work of the individual student. </p>

                  <h3>Time allocation</h3>
                  <p>Internal assessment is an integral part of the geography course, contributing
                     25% to the final assessment in the SL course and 20% in the HL course. This
                     weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
                     knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as
                     the total time allocated to carry out the work. </p>
                  <p>It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours of teaching time for
                     both SL and HL should be allocated to the work. This should include: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the

                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Rationale</h4>
                     <p>The purpose of the internally assessed fieldwork is to amplify, reinforce
                        and extend principal geographic concepts and skills taught in class.
                        Fieldwork is intended to enrich the study of particular themes within the
                        course. It adds to the student’s knowledge, understanding and awareness and
                        helps to make learning more engaging and relevant. It provides opportunities
                        for learning through practical work and fosters the skills of cooperation,
                        organization, investigation and presentation. It also presents opportunities
                        for leadership. </p>
                     <p>Fieldwork involves the collection of primary data in the field and the
                        subsequent treatment, display and analysis of this information using
                        appropriate skills. The material is presented in a written report. </p>
                     <p>Fieldwork activities allow students to practise many of the skills listed
                        for internal assessment in the “Geographic skills” section of the guide and
                        to develop specific skills appropriate to the chosen fieldwork question.

                  <div class="section">
                     <h4>Scale and site</h4>
                     <p>Many types of investigation are possible, and the choice depends on the
                        opportunities offered by the local environment. The investigation must be
                        manageable and the site accessible. The topic chosen for investigation must
                        be on a <strong>local</strong> scale but it does not need to be undertaken
                        near the school. If necessary, when there are logistical or security
                        concerns, for example, the school site may be used and can provide several
                        fieldwork possibilities. </p>

                     <h4>Maps</h4>
                     <p>It is strongly recommended that maps are student‑generated, either by being
                        hand drawn or computer‑derived, and they must be made relevant to the study.
                        Maps that are downloaded or photocopied should be adapted to the student’s
                        own information. Normal map conventions must be followed. </p>

                     <h4>Risk assessment</h4>
                     <p>Schools are advised to follow health and safety guidelines (risk assessment)
                        in fieldwork, observing standard regulations as appropriate. Each school is
                        ultimately responsible for the health and safety of its students. </p>

                     <h4>Ethical guidelines</h4>
                     <p>Students should consider whether there are any ethical implications involved
                        in collecting fieldwork information, such as respect for the views of
                        individuals expressed during interviews, respect for the environment and the
                        integrity of the information. Further details are given in the <em>Ethical

                  <h3>Using assessment criteria for internal assessment</h3>
                  <p>For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified.
                     Each assessment criterion has level descriptors describing specific levels of
                     achievement together with an appropriate range of marks. The level descriptors
                     concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to
                     achieve may be included in the description. </p>
                  <p>Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the
                     criteria using the level descriptors. </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The same assessment criteria are provided for both SL and HL.</li>
                     <li>The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most
                        accurately the level attained by the student, using the best‑fit model. A
                        best‑fit approach means that compensation should be made when a piece of
                        work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
                        awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement
                        against the criterion. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a
                        level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded. </li>
                     <li>When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors
                        for each criterion until they reach a descriptor that most appropriately
                        describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of work seems to
                        fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
                        one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen. </li>
                     <li>Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should
                        award the upper marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities
                        described to a great extent. Teachers should award the lower marks if the
                        student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent. </li>
                     <li>Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and
                        decimals) are not acceptable. </li>
                     <li>Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should
                        concentrate on identifying the appropriate descriptor for each assessment
                        criterion. </li>
                     <li>The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should
                        be achievable by a student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes
                        if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed. </li>
                     <li>A student who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one
                        criterion will not necessarily attain high levels of achievement in relation
                        to other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low level of
                        achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement
                        levels for the other criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall
                        assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of
                        marks. </li>
                     <li>It is recommended that the assessment criteria be available to
                        students.</li>

                     <h4>Relationship to the syllabus</h4>
                     <p>The fieldwork study for both HL and SL students must be related to material
                        in a geographic inquiry topic or sub-topic and its development in the
                        syllabus, whether it is from the optional themes, the core theme, or the HL
                        extension. It can combine two or more topics or themes. </p>
                     <p>The fieldwork must be on a <strong>local</strong> scale and involve the
                        collection of <strong>primary</strong> information. The chosen topic may be
                        environmental, physical or human, or may integrate approaches. </p>
                     <p>Global issues are unsuitable for study unless they can be adapted to the
                        local scale. For example, the SL/HL core theme unit 3 “Global resource
                        consumption and security”, sub-topic 3 on the development of resource
                        stewardship strategies could be applied at the local scale. </p>
                     <p>The following topics within the core theme, the <strong>optional</strong>
                        themes B, C, D, E and F, and the HL extension are <strong>unlikely</strong>
                        to be suitable for fieldwork investigation. </p>

                        through images or as text. (Students are advised to remember the word limit

                     <p>The fieldwork question (the precise inquiry) guides the fieldwork
                        investigation. It must be focused, appropriate and stated as a question that
                        can be answered through the collection of primary information in the field.
                        Where appropriate, students can make a brief preliminary judgment or
                        prediction answering the fieldwork question. This prediction may be
                        formulated as a hypothesis. </p>

                        context, explaining why and where the fieldwork investigation is to be
                        carried out. This can include relevant spatial, physical, socio‑economic
                        conditions and other background information, concepts or characteristics. A
                        map of the research area and/or the locations used in the fieldwork
                        investigation is essential to provide the necessary spatial element. </p>

                        relates, which geographic inquiry topic or sub-topic in the syllabus,
                        whether it is from the optional themes, the core theme, or the HL extension.
                        It can be drawn from a combination of two or more topics or themes. </p>

                        proficiency</h3>
                     <p>IB students must become fluent in the academic language associated with each
                        of the subjects they study so that they can fully engage and demonstrate
                        their proficiency. Geography is no exception. It has its own language using
                        many words that are commonly encountered in everyday life, but in the
                        context of study they may have a different and often much more precise
                        meaning. The agreed understanding of meanings among academics globally
                        allows them to communicate, collaborate and make progress in investigations
                        of the world. In developing their understandings, students are developing
                        what Cummins (1979) calls cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP). </p>
                     <p>Figure 1 is a framework to help teachers plan strategies for student CALP
                        development as part of learning within the subject. The activities are
                        transferable and can be used in a variety of learning situations. </p>

                     <h3>Understanding the framework for planning CALP development</h3>
                     <p>The framework is organized as a grid. The component skills of CALP
                        (including thinking skills, which go hand in hand with academic language
                        proficiency) are set out horizontally and the pedagogy appears in vertical
                        columns. </p>
                     <h4>Activating background knowledge</h4>
                     <p>Background knowledge is the existing knowledge a student has in terms of the
                        language of the subject. This may be from a previous course and could be in
                        a different language altogether. When this is activated, it provides a base
                        for new learning. </p>
                     <h4>Scaffolding and practice</h4>
                     <p>Scaffolding is a strategy that enables learners to build on their background
                        knowledge to extend their learning so they can accomplish more difficult
                        tasks. Scaffolding activities makes new learning meaningful by putting it
                        into context. New learning is fully acquired through practice. </p>
                     <h4>Demonstrating CALP</h4>
                     <p>Independently demonstrating and applying CALP in new and varied situations
                        is a sign of successful learning. This new learning will now become part of
                        a student’s background knowledge upon which newer and more extended learning
                        can be built in the next cycle. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="section">
                     <h3>Using the framework for planning CALP development</h3>
                     <p>It is not expected that every single box in the framework will be completed
                        in detail in each case. A lesson is often likely to focus on only certain
                        skills and aspects of pedagogy. However, over a period of time, in a series
                        of lessons or units of inquiry, it would be sound practice to ensure that
                        all the dimensions have been adequately addressed. </p>
                     <h3>Additional pedagogy: Affirming identity</h3>
                     <p>Affirming student identity is a central underpinning pedagogical principle
                        for successful learning and activities to develop CALP are embedded in this.
                        Affirming identity includes explicitly valuing students’ skills and
                        knowledge in all their languages, and recognizing these as resources for
                        teaching and learning new ways of thinking and knowing. For further
                        explanations about pedagogy and the research background, please refer to
                           <em>Developing academic literacy in IB programmes</em> (August 2014). </p>
                     <h3>Developing the CALP required for the analysis of graphs and charts</h3>
                     <p>Graphs and charts are commonly used for data analysis and, therefore, an
                        ability to read them accurately is important for learner success. DP
                        students may begin their course with different background knowledge of data
                        analysis and graphs. For example, scientific data analysis emphasizes
                        accuracy and objectivity. Some students may be familiar with reading graphs
                        in a more subjective manner, employing adjectives and adverbs such as huge
                        increase” and “dramatically fell”. Students have to learn the appropriate
                        language in order to be accurate and objective in decoding and constructing
                        graphs and charts. </p>
                     <p>The following teaching and learning activities follow the structure of the
                        framework for developing CALP and aim to: </p>
                     <ul>

                        <li>activate previous knowledge of language used in the description of
                           graphs and charts</li>

                        <li>build up and refine academic language used in the description of graphs
                           and charts</li>

                        <li>provide opportunities for practising and processing the academic
                           language</li>

                        <li>consolidate and apply knowledge of the academic language.</li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>(Depending on the student cohort and their previous knowledge, some of the
                        activities may be redundant. They may, however, be useful for
                        differentiation and used in collaboration with a specialist language support
                        teacher in certain contexts.) </p>

                  <h2>Developing the cognitive language proficiency (CALP) required to define and
                     assess indicators of development </h2>
                  <p>The description, analysis and comparison of different places based on their
                     disparities are essential elements of the DP geography course. For this
                     students need to use very specific terminology about indicators/indices of
                     development. Sometimes they will have previous background knowledge but this
                     must be expanded for the students to be able to develop critical thinking about
                     the variety and the validity of the different measurements. </p>
                  <p>The following teaching and learning activities follow the structure of the
                     framework for developing CALP and aim to: </p>
                  <ul>

                     <li>activate previous knowledge to identify measurements of disparities
                        (indicators)</li>

                     <li>build up and refine academic language used in the measurements of
                        disparities and assess their validity/usefulness </li>

                     <li>practise the use of the academic language used in the measurements of
                        disparities and assess their validity/usefulness </li>

                     <li>consolidate and apply the knowledge of the academic language to exam-type
                        questions.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>The starting point might require the introduction of more or less basic
                     language depending on the background of the students. For example, some of them
                     will be familiar with basic birth rate, death rate or Gross Domestic Product
                     whereas others will not. </p>

                                 <li>Introduce the topic by asking the students to look at the

                                    rural, urban, etc). They may want to follow the visible thinking
                                    routine “See, Think, Wonder” by asking each other questions
                                    about the photographs. This routine encourages students to make
                                    careful observations and thoughtful interpretations. <br />Once
                                    they have discussed the differences (disparities) they have

                                 <li>Introduce the term <strong>indicators</strong>. Make sure they
                                    understand that “measurements” (indicators) must be “measurable”
                                    but can be of a different nature (qualitative, quantitative,
                                    composite).</li>
                                 <li>Brainstorm with the students the indicators they are already

                                    indicators such as GDP/GNI per capita, literacy rate, birth
                                    rate, death rate etc.</li>
                                 <li>Ask the students to look at the photographs again and describe
                                    the disparities but now using indicators, for example, “I saw
                                    that the building materials in the house in photo B were cheap.
                                    I now think that it might be because the GNI per capita in that
                                    country is low so people cannot afford good quality
                                    housing.”</li>
                                 <li>Ask the students to write a paragraph based on the disparities
                                    described in the previous point. </li>

                                 <li>Ask the students to classify the indicators they brainstormed

                                    order to add them under each heading. The website <a
                                       href="http://www.gapminder.org">www.gapminder.org</a> has a
                                    large database with definitions for all sorts of indicators.
                                    Each pair should find one indicator for each heading and come up
                                    with a definition. It does not matter if some pairs of students
                                    use the same one as they will be selected at the end of the
                                    lesson. You can give them free “guided” choice but, if you do
                                    that, the cards for activity 3 will have to be produced in the

                                    and reliability. Ask the students to consider things such as
                                    availability for the different countries, usefulness,
                                    reliability and how well they contribute to <strong>measuring
                                       each factor</strong>. They can use the internet for research
                                    but the census must be the source of many of them.</li>
                                 <li>Each pair of students then presents one indicator to the class
                                    and, as a whole group, they agree on two per factor to be added
                                    to the main table (or you point them in the direction of the
                                    ones in the cards if you want to use the ready-made ones for
